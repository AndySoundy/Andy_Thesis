	of elasmobranches. Found that blue sharks and dogfish would preferentially
	attack an artifical dipole that was hidden, even when placed next
	to a piece of food which suggests that for short-range feeding behaviour
	the electric sense is more important than even smell. Measured the
	response rate as 5nV/cm but this was a conservative estimate as it
	assumed that the shark was alligned directly with the dipole moment
	created by the electrodes of the experiment. A short article that
	mostly focuses on the responses to electric fields it does mention
	magnetic field responses however it is only briefly and concludes
	simply that the rays used in the experiment could detect the magnetic
	field but remains unsure whether the rays were directly detecting
	the magnetic field or the induced voltage by swimming near the magnetic

  note = {IMPORTANCE: 5*. An excellent paper, the author tagged four scalloped
	hammerheads off Las Animas Island in the Sea of Cortez. Highly directional
	swimming was recorded when the sharks ventured out at night to hunt.
	The author correlated their movements to possible variations in temperature,
	current, ground topography (which the animals were unable to see
	from the depths they were swimming at), light levels (to determine
	whether the animals could have been navigating by star/moonlight)
	and variations in the earths magnetic field. No correlations were
	found for any of the values that could explain the sharks swimming
	very similar geographic routes except for using variations in the
	earths magnetic field. Less than a 50nT rise or fall between successive
	maxima or minima in the magnetic field but it appears that the sharks
	swam along the boundary between magnetic slope and plateau as well
	as in valleys or along ridges. In several instances the sharks encountered
	a "wall" of steep geomagnetic increases whereupon the animals reversed
	direction and swam back the way they had come. A graph is provided
	in the article (Fig. 11) that shows that the sharks was actively
	swimming at a depth that gave it the greatest geomagnetic intensity
	gradient, almost three times the gradient at the surface. In conclusion
	proposed that perhaps the shark compared readings from ampullae across
	the body to determine the magnetic field gradient.},

  journal = {Journal of Biophysics},

  volume = {2009},
  note = {IMPORTANCE: 5*+. Tim's latest paper on shark navigation. Quantitatively
	addresses the electric fields that the shark should experience while
	it swims through the earth's magnetic field. Proposes that the shark
	uses a ration of electric field amplitudes at different frequencies
	to determine it's compass heading which should be independent of
	swimming speed and the strength of the magnetic field. This ratio
	is dependent on the swimming modulation amplitude (a) but for values
	of a less than 1 the ratio is only weakly dependent on a. Both the
	electrical amplitudes involved should be detectable by the ampullae
	based on the thresholds determined in Kajiura:2002 as well as others.
	While a linear model of the neural response would be unable to account
	for drift we see from studies such as Montgomery:1999 that the neural
	response is indeed non-linear. Also addresses the work of Hodson:2000
	and others where magnets inserted in the nasal cavity of the short-tailed
	stingray would interrupt an induction-based navigation sense unless
	the fish was kept rigid to an accuracy of ~100um. Possible work on

	that a massive field ~ 100uVm-1 and higher produce less response

	are in general more sensitive than shorter ones but due to the capacity
	of the canals there is a loss of higher frequencies in longer canals.

  pages = {325-339},
  note = {IMPORTANCE: 5*+. Mike Paulin's first article on shark navigation,
	obviously this is super important and by this time you probably have
	it memorized but here we go. He goes into the then current work in
	the field by Kalmijn and Klimley. He investigates Kalmijn's ideas
	of pasive and active navigation but points towards the problems of
	sharks being unable to detect dc signals and of the issues involved
	in Kalmijn's passive navigation wherein it would seem Kalmijn proposes
	that the shark swims out of any moving water and then uses that stationary
	water as a guide as to where it should head as it swims back into
	the current. Paulin points also to the issue of naturally occurring
	electric fields in the order of hundreds of microvolts due to the
	movement of the water and the ions within and then points to the
	dc filter and says that for the time-period that the ampullae of
	the shark cover the fields in the water are considered dc and so
	not picked up by the animals. For a short time he goes into the idea
	of electrical lensing that would occur around the resistive body
	of the shark in the conducting medium of the sea and then points
	to that increasing the voltages across an ampullae in the shark rather
	than some lone ampullae and so increasing the animal's sensitivity.
	Goes extensively into the idea of wave-analysis as a way for the
	shark to determine its heading especially working out the differences
	in frequency and amplitude involved in heading north-south compared
	to east-west. By comparing the inputs from the electrosense and the
	vestibular sense the shark could determine a heading direction undettered
	by current drift. He backs up his claim of waveform analysis by pointing
	out that 19% of vestibulo-cerebellar cells in dogfish respond at
	twice the head oscillation frequency. Finally he points to the hyoid
	group of ampullae as a possible base for navigation citing migratory
	species that have hyoid ampullae only and eat plankton and carnivorour
	species that are non-migratory and have other ampullae but not hyoid
	ampullae.},
